I SELECTED THE STARS X/  SMOKE 3D CODE

DIRECTX 11 3D SMOKE SIMULATION BY EULERIAN GRID METHOD FOR SOLVING NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION AND RENDERING BY VOLUME-RAY CASTING, ALL WITH COMPUTE SHADERS

I open a new folder iocal c folder on my laptop

I right clicked on the empty page in the folder and selected git bash here

I then forked the code by clicking fork at the top right corner

i was able to generate my own fork repository and also create a clone http weblink url and copied it

i then opened my Git software and cloned it by using the "git clone https://github.com/nwalablessing/Smoke3D.git"

once code was completely cloned it copied the souce code and git history

thn i did a directory listing using the "ls" command

i then set up a remote using "gihttps://github.com/StarsX/Smoke3D.gitt remote -v" it points to the fork allowing me to push and pull from github

using git remote add upstream https://github.com/StarsX/Smoke3D.git

using a git remote -v command it then list out the remote including the upstream just added.


I then opened the "intellij IDEA" software when to my files and the loacted the  smoke 3D folder


then i ran the codes using the run buttons and i also checked for errors.
